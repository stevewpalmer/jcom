# Edit

This folder contains the source files for a simple text editor 
based on the DOS Brief editor from the 1990s.

### Starting

Run the editor from the shell with the `edit` command. By default
this opens the editor with a blank file. Specify one or more
filenames after the command to open those files, each in their
own buffer.
