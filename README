This repository contains the source code for the JFor FORTRAN compiler,
the JCom compiler toolkit and the JComLib run-time library.

JCom is an experiment in creating a compiler for various languages in
C# using the .NET Reflection classes to emit the output code and to
define a single back-end and run-time for all these languages. Currently
only FORTRAN is implemented through the JFor front-end but the plan is
to add support for further languages.

At the present time, FORTRAN support in JFor is a subset of Fortran 77
with various pieces not yet implemented. Consequently this is very much
a work in progress. Consider this alpha quality software.
