# Calc

This folder contains the source files for a simple spreadsheet.
This is currently a work in progress.

Run calc from the shell with the `calc` command. By default,
this opens calc with an empty worksheet and a default filename.
Specify one or more filenames after the command to open those files,
each in their own worksheet.

`calc helloworld.clc`

You can also open worksheets from within calc with the File > Edit
command or import a CSV file into a new worksheet with File -> Import.

Press the '/' key to open the command menu.
