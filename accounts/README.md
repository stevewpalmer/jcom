# Accounts

Accounts implements a very simple disk-based personal account tracking
program that was originally implemented in FreeBasic. It should be
relatively easy to understand how it works.

The key features are:

* Addition of fixed monthly expenses which are automatically applied to all months.
* Entry of monthly expenses and calculation of the running entry and exit balance for months.
* The ability to summarise expenditures by category.
* Search across all statements by name or value.

Note that the FreeBasic version had a few bugs which are fixed in this
version. I have yet to port these fixes back to the FreeBasic version.
