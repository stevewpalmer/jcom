# Shell

This folder contains the source files for a very simple shell interface
that allows running the other programs and manipulating files.

To run the shell:

```
Shell 1.0.0
(c) Steven Palmer 2013-2024

$
```

On startup, the home folder will be the current folder and this will also
be the home folder for all applications run from the shell.
